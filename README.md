# Air Hockey - An Interactive Game

Originally, it was built for Firefox OS. 
Due to Firefox OS shutdown, I modified the web app into web-based game.
However, it sill can not work on smartphone, so 2P mode is not workable.

### Final project in Web Apps class
* ~~Native JavaScript App on Firefox OS~~
* Written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS to complete the game
* With jQuery library
* [Available on Marketplace of Firefox OS](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/air-hockey-3?src=search) (not developed anymore) 

### Features
* 1P against AI or 2P mode
* Multi-variant setting for friction, speed, and even AI level
